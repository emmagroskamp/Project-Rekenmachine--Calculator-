# Project-Rekenmachine--Calculator-
 
Project Rekenmachine also known as Project Calculator. 

This calculator was my very first project in C#. The main goal was to create a simple calculator which let's you do the following things:
1. adding up
2. substract
3. devide 
4. multiply

Every number and operator has their own button. When you click on the button it will add that digit or operator to the textbox. 
To get the answer to your problem all you have to do is press '='. The answer will be displayed in the same textbox of where your previous problem was written. 

Later on I added a new feature, the scientific calculator. 

To access this scientific calculator all you have to do is press on the 'Science' button. A new form will open with new options. 
The scientific calculator let's you calculate the square root and exponentiation. If you prefer the simple calculator, the "Basic" button on the scientific calculator will open the form of the simple calculator again.
